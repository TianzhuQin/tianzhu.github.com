excerpt: Have you ever been thinking about hiring an AI to help you trade? For that purpose, I implement DDRN and DQN methods to seek money in stock market. It turns out different configurations result in differing outcome. In comparison, DQN is not as good to find the optimal Q-Table when monitoring time series, but fortunately we still have money coming by DDRN. <br> (PS) I will not be responsible if you lose any. But if you earn something please give me a star ;) <br> <img src="/assets/img/DRL.png" height="430" width="300">
