excerpt: I hereby predict the quality of wines by differing machine learning methods, i.e. Polynomial functions and Non-Parametric Approaches. I only showed the polynomial part in the picture below, but in the essay I compared some state-of-art algorithms, e.g. SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoosting for learning and for good wines. <br> <img src="/assets/img/framework.jpg" height="180" width="470">
